title: Update!

---

The last few weeks we were not able to do much, but we did work a little on the Edt-MainFrame. We ordered many little packages from all kinds of webshops, and bought a flightcase that could house the [main components for live usage](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/122165257):

The idea is to have everything we need in terms of Arduino's and other fragile components build into a stage ready housing; a flightcase. With some off the shelve components it's relatively straightforward to build something that works and is extendable, we choose to use 'keystones' for most of the connectors:

These keystones can be put in a cheap patch panel, this one we bought for around 10 euros:

To mount the Arduino's and other stuff, we bought a 19 inch rack shelf for another 10 euros that fits in a flightcase:

Mounted together it forms a solid and extendable housing that can be setup in no time, ideal for stage use:

## Edt-2000 ecosystem - visual

The whole ecosystem can be divided into sensors and actuators, which are bound together by the controller; MaxMSP. In the future, we would love to give each sensor/actuator more responsibilities; for now MaxMSP is an easy method to experiment and develop quickly.

As you can see, a variety of sensors and actuators form the eventual system, all connected through UTP cables, wirelessly or by other ways we don't even know now.

## Creative Coding Amsterdam

Last Friday we went to a meeting in Amsterdam: [Creative Coding Amsterdam](http://www.creativecodingamsterdam.com). This is a community of people interested in all creative aspects of computer programming. It is a place to meet for beginners as well as advanced users, for professionals as well as people coding just for fun. The Edt-2000 fits right in!

During this meetup we told about our system, and gave a live demo of the [Airdrum](https://www.facebook.com/events/1372338339447256/). [Photos can be found here.](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMH-M4rksgzHalJdNbSYW-HbguJYKYb_ye9T02DsP2Jt2fFBN5VhAOMNKRkMELKsw?key=OHVzdGNxODBjWlRCdjI4dWYtSzA3bHhaNUpERFhB)

We had a lot of fun, and in the next weeks we hope to have some more time to continue our work as we are excited to see what's next.
