A few weeks we had our first performance in a local venue, which was great! Everything was captured on video, it was only a short show but you have to start somewhere.

Because we have another show the 17th of December, we have been working on getting more light effects working. We bought a DotStar RGB LED strip and have been experimenting with this:

Also, at a discount shop we bought very cheap Christmas lights, which we hooked up to a 'Thing' and made it remotely controllable by a nunchuk:

We also worked on getting all the stuff better fixed into the flightcase:

We found an old fiber casing in the dumpster, which we re-used as it can open as a drawer:

We are hard at work to get everything ready, so after 17th of December we can update the blog again with some more text and explanation :)
