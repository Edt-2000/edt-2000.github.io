title: Edt-Pedal & Edt-Presets system

---

Yes, another update! It's time to continue with the project, we will try to post more updates and get something going!

## Edt-Pedal

First thing first; the Edt-Pedal. If you take a look at our [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/123154551), you can read that the Edt-Pedal will make it possible to switch between 'presets' for the whole Edt-2000 system. These presets will be used to switch functionality of the Edt-Trak and other components on the fly, because you would want multiple different *types of control* from a single device.

We choose to buy a pre-made guitar pedal ([Digitech FS3X](http://digitech.com/en/products/fs3x-3-button-footswitch)), as it already is in a sturdy enclosure and is made to be used on stage. A quick Google search gave us the wiring scheme, which we confirmed by opening it as soon as it arrived (it had to happen :)).

As we kind of finished the flightcase, it was time to put everything together and place in on the 19 inch plate. This took a saturday morning and some tiewraps and soldering... Pictures!:

We used a piece of old network cable to connect the Arduino shield to the 6.5 mm jack plug, the wiring scheme is in the [Github repository](https://github.com/Edt-2000/Edt-Trak). If there are any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us!

It's still in a prototype phase, but you get the idea. Somewhere in the future we will redo everything a bit more neat, for now i t should just work...

After a morning of DIY, this is your 'product'. Ready to go on the road! Kind of..

![Product](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/2016-08-27%2012.25.06.jpg)

As you might have noticed, we used the same Arduino as the Edt-Trak; we had to hack the code a little to send Edt-Pedal messages when a button is pressed. There is also some code to provide '[debouncing](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Debounce)'. Also, if you hold the button down, it triggers the serialPrint every X ms.

![Arduino code](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-28%20at%2021.45.53.png)

The Processing sketch we used for the Edt-Trak is also tweaked a little to detect Pedal/Trak messages and send the correct OSC messages. This is very important; the Edt-Cetera/Preset system doesn't know a thing about how the values are read; only that it receives ````/Pedal 1````. We can swap sensors, use a different pedal, etc. Separation of concerns!

![Processing sketch](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-28%20at%2021.45.24.png)

As always, the full code is available on Github, please feel free to try.

## MaxMSP - Edt-Cetera

Now that we receive OSC messages, we can start with creating some logic to switch between presets in MaxMSP. After some trial and error (MaxMSP is still a complex program to work with) we created the following patch:

![Edt-Pedal](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-28%20at%2021.41.44.png)

We try to keep every component in it's own patch, so that we can easily use it in other patches as a standalone object. That's what you see in the Edt-Preset logic:

![Edt-Preset](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-28%20at%2021.41.29.png)

This patch is a bit more complex; you see the Edt-Pedal coming in at the top, which increments or decrements the counter for the selected preset. That in turn controls a switch that routes the OSC messages (4th output of the Edt-Pedal) to one of the 10 outputs. There is also a 'RESET', which sends a ````bang```` every time a preset is changed or the ````MODE```` button is pressed. This gives a patch the oppurtunity to stop output when a preset is deselected; it could for instance stop playing a tone or turn of a light. For example, the Edt-Trak resets it's values to 0 when a ````RESET```` is received.

![Edt-Trak](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-28%20at%2021.41.57.png)

The rest of the patch is mostly used to switch off OSC output when a preset is switched; only when you actively turn on the preset, it starts doing something. The extra ````OSC-route```` is to quickly select a preset, it will also directly activate a preset by sending a 1 to open the ````gate````. (if this is unclear, once we have it tested a bit more we will make a video)

One final nice gimmick; MaxMSP makes it really easy to send out OSC messages as well to anything that can receive it. To display the currently selected preset, a simple [TouchOSC](http://hexler.net/software/touchosc) page was made that can receive numbers and display this as feedback. 

![Max patch](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/4548386/hosted/edt-2000/2016-08-28%20Edt%20Pedal%20blog/Screen%20Shot%202016-08-28%20at%2022.21.24.png)

And finally, a video of the Edt-Pedal with feedback display on a Nexus 5X running TouchOSC.

Next step is to start experimenting with sound control, as we now also have a bit more time the coming weeks, so stay tuned :)
